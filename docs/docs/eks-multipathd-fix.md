## Installing Device Mapper Multipath on Amazon EKS

If you are using EKS and need to use EBS and Pure Storage at the same time please read [this blog.](https://blog.2vcps.io/2020/06/16/hey-dont-break-ebs/)

The `multipath.conf` file on each cluster node should set a blacklist in order to prevent `multipathd` from managing EBS volumes. This example will make sure `multipathd` only manages Pure Storage volumes.

**Note: Your environment and requirements may vary, this is provided as a possible solution.**

```
blacklist {
    device {
        vendor "*"
    }
}
blacklist_exceptions {
    device {
        vendor "PURE"
        product "*"
    }
}
```
